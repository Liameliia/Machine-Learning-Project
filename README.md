# Project Data Analysis
This project aims to compare and evaluate multiple classification algorithms to determine the most effective model for accurate predictions. The dataset undergoes preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature importance analysis, and model evaluation to uncover key patterns and trends.

The models assessed include:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Naive Bayes (NB)

The dataset used in this analysis is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD) which can be accessed below
